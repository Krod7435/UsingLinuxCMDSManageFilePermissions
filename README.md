# UsingLinuxCMDSManageFilePermissions

Lab scenario:
In this scenario I work as a security analyst to work with Linux to change file permissions for company’s database. This job included lots of coding infrastructure to prioritize file permissions for certain users to be given access based on their privileges for their permission access. In this issue I’m working with a research team. Part of my job is to ensure users on this team are authorized with the appropriate permissions; this will help keep their system secure. My task is to examine existing permissions on the file system. I need to determine if the permissions match the authorization that should be given. If they do not match, I need to modify the permissions to authorize the appropriate users and remove any unauthorized access for the Linux security database for the user permissions.
